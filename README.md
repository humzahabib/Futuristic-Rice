# Futuristic-Rice
My cyberpunk themed rice for Arch + Hyprland


Most of the stuff in this rice is being done through hotkeys. I am listing some of them here, rest you can find in hypr -> hyprland.conf


### KeyMaps

- Super + I = Opens Firefox
- Super + Enter = Opens Kitty terminal (you can change the terminal variable in the hyprland conf if you are using another terminal)
- Super + M = Opens App Launher Menu
- Super + K = Launchers terminal spotify client
- Super + C = Closes currectly active window
- Super + F = Opens Thunar File explorer

### Side Notes:

1) Terminal always opens on workspace 1 (unless you use Super + T which opens a terminal on workspace 2)
2) Firefox always opens on workspace 2
3) Spotify client always opens on workspace 3
4) Steam always opens on workspace 4
